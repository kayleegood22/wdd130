    <p>Hi, my name is Kaylee Good and I am majoring in software engineering. In my free time, I love to play guitar, sing and write</p>
   <p>songs. I have also performed at local restaurants and festivals in my hometown in Washington. I graduated high school in June,</p>
   <p>so this is my first semester of college. I love Brigham Young University-Idaho so far, and I'm excited to learn more in Web Fundamentals!</p>
